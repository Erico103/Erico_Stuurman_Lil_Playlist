            <h1>Hi! Nice to meet you!</h1>
            My name is Erico  Stuurman and I am 52 years old. I am living in the Netherlands in a city called Doetinchem.
            <br/><br/>
             I started front end development back in august, and I do like coding, although
             some modules are quite hard.<br/><br/> This project is a playlist, where you can enter a song, the artist, genre and a rating.
             The project is done in React, and its very interesting. So interesting that i purchased a React course from Udemy, to learn more about it and because some things are a bit harder for me to understand, like prop handling or components data transferring, thus I figure, this course is money well spent.
